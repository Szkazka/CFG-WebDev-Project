  <p id="intro">József Attila was long thought to be schizophrenic, but nowadays it is increasingly common to view him as suffering from borderline personality disorder, which has since gained widespread recognition.</p>

  <p>The condition is becoming more familiar even among laypeople, and sometimes, akin to narcissistic personality disorder, it is unjustly attributed to certain individuals when the diagnostic criteria seem to be met at first glance. </p>

  <p>Looking at József Attila's childhood, experienced neglect and traumas, as well as his adult relational dynamics and established dynamics, <mark>the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder stands on solid ground.</mark> Dr. Attila Németh (2000) writes extensively about this in his book "József Attila's Psychiatric Illnesses". However, without delving into this in detail, I would like to shed light on why, as an adult, when he sought - mainly psychoanalytic - therapies, they couldn't help him. </p>

  <p>The short answer to this is as follows: <mark>because at that time, borderline personality disorder diagnosis was not yet known, and consequently, they couldn't treat it accordingly.</mark> Today, we know that in severe cases of the disorder, <mark>traditional analytic techniques (which József Attila's therapists also used in the 1930s) are not effective and can even worsen the patient's condition.</mark> The patient may react incomprehensibly to conventional analytic interpretations, and exploring childhood experiences alone does not help. For these patients, <mark>Kernberg proposes a modified analysis, focusing not on uncovering and interpreting the past, but on the patient-therapist relationship.</mark> The therapist must create an empathetic, understanding, and emotionally accessible environment for the patient, capable of compensating for parental dysfunction. Thus, temporarily assuming a maternal role, the therapist provides corrective emotional experiences about the damaged mother-child relationship. These frameworks allow, among other things, for the containment and appropriate treatment of rapidly changing, highly intense, and unstable reactions (Kuritárné, 2004). </p>

  <p>Illustrating this, it is understandable why Gyömrői Edit also couldn't cope with József Attila. The analyst, following the psychoanalytic prescriptions of his time, did not assume the maternal role imposed by the poet. His task was only to make the past conscious and interpret it. When József Attila relived the mother-child relationship in therapy, and corresponding emotional attitudes and expectations arose towards Gyömrői Edit, she essentially demanded what, according to Kernberg's modified analysis, is essential for the treatment of borderline personality disorder. However, the analyst of her time, according to the prevailing teachings of psychoanalysis, could not provide this. <mark>The poet mercilessly reproached her for this, with the final lines of It hurts so much: "So she can hear /while living here what she denied / at her pleases is her own worth. / She has deprived / the outside inside escaping life /of the last chance for a rebirth." (JAÖV p.390)</mark></p>

  <p>What prospects could we have today for József Attila's therapy? It can be said that alongside psychoanalytic therapies, many other therapeutic approaches have undergone significant developments in the eighty years since then, and new methods have emerged in the treatment of personality /. Psychiatric medications are also much more effective than they were at that time, and in the case of borderline syndrome, combining psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment is often justified. Among other things, medications help a borderline individual to calm down the very intense and extreme emotional storm that constantly rages within them, thus making the psychotherapeutic situation easier for them, as it is easier to think about oneself and our relationships, to reflect on them in a less irritated, more focused, better functioning state (Gabbard, 2016). However, it is not an exaggeration to say that even the most experienced psychotherapists would have a hard time with József Attila; nevertheless, they would have better chances in preventing suicide. </p>
